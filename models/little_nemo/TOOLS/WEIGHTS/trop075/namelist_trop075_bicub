 - grid_inputs holds parameters for the scripgrid routine which reformats information 
   about the input grids
 - scripgrid always needs a coordinates.nc file in the
   current directory and creates the remapped grid file correspondingly
 - it uses the following namelist block to determine its actions
     method:  only 'regular' is yet implemented, this assumes a cartesian grid
     input_lon: name of longitude variable in the input_file
     input_lat: name of latitude variable in the input_file
     nemo_lon: name of longitude variable in the coordinates.nc
     nemo_lat: name of latitude variable in the coordinates.nc

 - remap_inputs holds parameters for the scrip routine which calculates the weights
   needed to convert between two grids
 - two remap grid files are required as output by scripgrid
 - num_maps is either 1 or 2 depending on whether the reverse transformation is required
 - one or two interp_file names are then supplied; these hold the weights to convert 
   one grid to another
 - the map_name variable is just descriptive
 - map_method can be 'bilinear' 'bicubic' or 'conservative' (the latter untested)
 - normalize_opt should usually be 'frac' or else the user needs to do this scaling
   manually (this seems to the case for fractional ice cover)
 - restrict_type should be 'latitude' or 'latlon' in which case num_srch_bins only are 
   used in one or two directions
 - use_grid_area fields override the scrip calculation of area in case the model gets
   slightly different answers, but the area needs to be supplied in the input files
 - output_opt may be supplied and set to either 'scrip' or 'ncar-csm'

 -  shape_inputs are the input fields required by scripshape.f90
 -  first is the interpolation file created by scrip.f90 mapping data to model grid
 -  second is the name of the output weights file to create
 -  third is the east-west wrap to assume in the model (needed when calculating gradient 
          terms in the bicubic scheme); the number is just the number of columns on one side
          that are repeats of those on the opposite side (-1 for not cyclic)
